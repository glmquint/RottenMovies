\chapter{Feasibility Study}
\justifying
The very first step to perform is to look up for what type of data we need to create the application and how to handle it by performing a feasibility study.
\section{Dataset analysis and creation}
Initially we search online for available dataset, we ended up with five different files coming from Kaggle and imdb with a combined storage of 4.18 Gb:
\begin{itemize}
  \item title\textunderscore principal.tsv  
  \item name\textunderscore basic.tsv 
  \item title\textunderscore basic.tsv 
  \item title\textunderscore crew.tsv
  \item rotten\textunderscore movies.csv
  \item rotten\textunderscore reviews.csv 
\end{itemize} 
\paragraph{}
The first three were found on the imdb site containing general data about the title of the entries, type (not all were movies), cast, crew and other useful information. The last two came from Kaggle and they contain data scraped from the rotten tomatoes site regarding the movies rating and their reviews. All of these dataset were organized in a relational manner.
\paragraph{}
The next step was to delete all useless information and perform a join operation to generate one single final dataset for the document database. These operations were performed through a python script with the help of the pandas library and Google Colab, the end result was a single json file of 270 Mb. The structure of the document is the following:
