\chapter{Instruction Manual}

The application is accessible through a web browser and doesn't require an authentication to perform some basic navigation and scrolling of movies and reviews. To leave a review under a movie, follow top critics and receive personalized information, a user must log-in or sign-up to the service. Some notable and certified users may be registered by an administrator as a \textit{Top Critic} which can be followed by other users and whose reviews are highlighted under a movie

It is possible to search by 
\begin{itemize}
\item a string contained in the title
\item a range of year in which the movie has been produced
\item people that worked on the film. It is possible to build a list of names by employing a comma (,) and stating if the movie must include all names or at least one of them
\item genres. It is possible to build a list of genres by employing a comma (,) and stating if the movie must include all genres or at least one of them
\end{itemize}

The available sorting options are
\begin{itemize}
\item by top critic rating (the default)
\item by user critic rating
\item alphabetical order
\item by date of production
\end{itemize}
and the user can opt for an ascending or descending sort.

At any point the user can click on the pills of genres or crew members to perform a search with that value.

If a user isn't logged-in, the button under a movie says 'Login to Review' and brings to the login page. Otherwise it becomes 'Review' and clicking on it allows the quick creation or editing of the review for that movie.
