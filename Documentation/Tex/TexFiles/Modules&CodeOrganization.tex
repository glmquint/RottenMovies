First of all we follow the reverse-domain convention for the root package, before passing to analyzing the source code, we put in the Appendix the pom.xml file for the dependency \cref{subsec:pom}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{controller} is responsible for handling the request to the various endpoint with the use of Spring

	\item \emph{DAO} (Data Access Object) is responsible for accessing the databases and retrieving the necessary object

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{base} contains the classes responsible for handling the base connection the DBs, \emph{enums} is used as packet to differentiate the connection type in base of an enum for higher calls
	
		\item \emph{exception} is responsible for generating and handling a custom exception invoked when trying to access the wrong database
	
		\item \emph{interfaces} contains the various interfaces that map all the method for accessing the databases differentiated in base of the general field for the operation, they extends the \emph{AutoClosable} interface
		\item \emph{mongoDB} handles the operation on the MongoDB for the different entities
		\item \emph{neo4j} is the same as \emph{mongoDB} but for the Neo4j database
	
	\end{itemize}
	\item \emph{DTO} (Data Transfer Object) presents all the classes that are used as container of the data passed between the service layer and the presentation layer
